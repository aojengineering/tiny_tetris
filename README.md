# tiny_tetris
An Arduino based extremely small black-box tetris clone

This small project was created for fun and to learn a little about working with Arduino.  Inspiration is drawn from this project https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/BADFEED/tetris-clone-with-oled-ssd1306-i2c-for-arduino-nano-uno-8d9395?ref=similar&ref_id=152312&offset=4 and 30+ years of enjoying the game.

Since Tetris is a problem that has been solved (many times) I approached this as a black-box, did not refer to any existing implementation or discussion of the game and reverse engineered requirements and implementation from just playing it.

Hardware used was a custom 5 button setup connected to a Arduino Uno and displayed on a 1 inch feature phone screen.

About me:
  An experienced embedded developer who has performed full lifecycle development on a wide variety of safety-critical embedded applications for avionics, rail and agricultural machinery.  The Arduino is certainly a faster setup than other micros I have coded on!
